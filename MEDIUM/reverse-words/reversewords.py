"""Reverse word order, keeping spaces.

As a simple case, an empty string returns an empty string:

    >>> rev("")
    ''

A simple word is also the same:

    >>> rev("hello")
    'hello'

Here, we reverse the order of the words, preserving the space between:

    >>> rev("hello world")
    'world hello'

Here, we reverse the worlds, preserving space---so it it should start with
the 3 spaces that came after world, etc:

    >>> rev(" hello  world   ")
    '   world  hello '

To prove the alternate solution works:

    >>> rev(" hello  world   ")
    '   world  hello '
