"""Given a list of words, return the word with the most anagrams.

For a list of ['act', 'cat', 'bill']:
- 'act' and 'cat' are anagrams, so they both have 2 matching words.
- 'bill' has no anagrams, os it has one matching word (itself).

Given that 'act' is the first instance of the most-anagrammed word,
we return that.

    >>> find_most_anagrams_from_wordlist(['act', 'cat', 'bill'])
    'act'

Let's use a file of words where each line is a word:
    >>> import os, sys
    >>> all_words = [w.strip() for w in open(os.path.join(sys.path[0],'words.txt'))]
    >>> find_most_anagrams_from_wordlist(all_words)
    'angor'
