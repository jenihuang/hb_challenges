"""Using a binary search, find val in a range of 1-100. Return # of guesses.

Construct a list of 1-100 (inclusive). Write a binary search that searches
for val in that list (val will always be a number between 1 and 100).

Return the number of searches it took to find val. For a proper binary search
of 1-100, this should never be more than 7.

    >>> binary_search(50)
    1

    >>> binary_search(25)

    >>> binary_search(75)

    >>> binary_search(31) <= 7
    True

    >>> max([binary_search(i) for i in range(1, 101)])
