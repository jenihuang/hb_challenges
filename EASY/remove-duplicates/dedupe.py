"""Return new list from items with duplicates removed.

For example::

    >>> deduped([1, 1, 1])
    [1]

Keep items in the order where they first appeared::

    >>> deduped([1, 2, 1, 1, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]

A list with no duplicates would return the same::

    >>> deduped([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]

This should return a *new* list, not mutate the existing
list::

    >>> a = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> b = deduped(a)
    >>> a == b
    True

    >>> a is b
    False

An empty list should return an empty list::

    >>> deduped([])
    []
