"""How much rain is trapped in Codelandia?

No buildings mean no rain is captured::

    >>> rain([])
    0

All-same height buildings capture no rain::

    >>> rain([10])
    0

    >>> rain([10, 10])
    0

    >>> rain([10, 10, 10, 10])
    0

If there's nothing between taller buildings, no rain is captured::

    >>> rain([2, 3, 10])
    0

    >>> rain([10, 3, 2])
    0

If two tallest buildings are same height and on ends, it's easy::

    >>> rain([10, 5, 10])
    5

    >>> rain([10, 2, 3, 4, 10])
    21

    >>> rain([10, 4, 3, 2, 10])
    21

    >>> rain([10, 2, 4, 3, 10])
    21

If two tallest buildings are ends, but not the same height,
it will fall off the shorter of thh two::

    >>> rain([10, 2, 3, 4, 9])
    18

Rain falls off the left and right edges::

    >>> rain([2, 3, 10, 5, 5, 10, 3, 2])
    10

Trickier::

    >>> rain([2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 10, 7, 10, 5, 4, 3, 6, 2, 5, 2])
    15

Should also work with floats::

    >>> r = rain([4.5, 2.2, 2.2, 4])
    >>> round(r, 2)
    3.6
